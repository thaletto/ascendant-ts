# Source modules

The `src` tree contains the calculation modules exported by `astro-ascendant`.
The root entry point re-exports the public modules so consumers can use named
namespaces such as `Chart`, `Dasha`, `SAV`, and `Ephemeris`.

Calculations are Effect-based. Shared placement data is produced from an
ephemeris implementation and then passed to chart, dasha, Ashtakavarga, and
Jaimini calculations.
